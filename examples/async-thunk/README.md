# Example: `async-thunk`

This example demonstrates how you could orchestrate thunks with your services. It includes creating thunks with the provided selector and actionCreators which finally be reused on another service. You may take a reference with the [native approach](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#async) provided by the `Redux` official repository.
