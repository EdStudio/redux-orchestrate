# Example: `async-saga`

This example demonstrates how you could orchestrate sagas with your services. It includes creating saga with your selector and actionCreators which will then be reused and dynamically added to the saga middleware on the other service. You may take a reference with the [native approach](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/tree/master/examples/async) provided by the `redux-saga` official repository. If you prefer handling async tasks using a simplier syntax, there is also a `redux-thunk` example as an alternative.
