# Example: `todos`

This classic todos example shows you how your business logic could be quickly orchestrated with `createAggregate()` & `createService()`. By enabling [redux-devtools-extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension), you can montior the actions being dispatched automatically and thus making states changes on `Redux`. You may take a reference with the [native approach](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#todos) provided by the `Redux` official repository.

You can checkout the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/EdStudio/redux-orchestrate/tree/master/examples/todos)
